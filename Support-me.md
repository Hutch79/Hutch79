Hello, thank you for supporting me!

Here you can find some affiliate programs from providers that I have been using myself for several years and that I can really recommend.  
I've been using all the listed providers for more than a year and never had any problems with the support or the quality of their products.

To be clear, if you register an account with any of the following links, I will receive approximately 10% of what you spend with these services at no additional cost to you!

This is a German company that offers game servers, dedicated servers as well as virtual servers.

I use a virtual server (The KVM Game Ryzen S) from them to host various Docker projects, such as Bookstack or even Uptimekuma.

The price performance is one of the best I have found so far and the support is also very good.

Deinserverhost also offers Game Servers, which I have also used. These also have a very good price-performance ratio, and during my use I have never experienced that the server has lagged.

Lima-City is a German hosting company that offers a lot of features for a reasonable price, while also providing good support.

I have been using their web space "Mini" for over three years and have never had a problem. When I have questions, no matter how stupid they are sometimes, the support has always answered quickly and with a solution in mind.

However, what I like most about Lima-City is that they don't limit you.
You get storage space and you can do whatever you want with it. No websites or database limit. Whether you want to have 10 or 100 websites, as long as you don't overuse the memory they don't care.
